                    <p>If you think that pickup trucks were unable to race, well the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series will prove you wrong. It's the third series in NASCAR's divisions behind the Cup and Xfinity series, and is the only series in NASCAR to race production pickup truck-based stock cars. Since it hasn't been around as long as the other 2 series, it isn't as popular as them, but they draw good enough crowds at the venues they race at. And in some sense, the Truck series serves as a beginning point for a driver in their career. Many all time great drivers started out in the Truck series and slow make their way up through to the Cup series, such as Carl Edwards, Kyle and Kurt Busch, and Greg Biffle.</p>

                    <h3>The Idea</h3>
                    <p>The Truck Series got its start in 1991, when a group of SCORE off-road racers grew concerned about the future of desert racing. These 4 racers, Dick Landfield, Jimmy Smith, Jim Venable, and Frank "Scoop" Vessels,all went to the Vice President of NASCAR's Western Operations, Ken Clapp, to promote their idea of a pavement truck racing series. However, after consulting with Bill France Jr., the son of NASCAR's founder, the plans fell apart. Clapp would then tell the 4 that if a truck was built, then NASCAR woulf conider it. The prototype truck, built by Gary Collins, was shown during Speedweeks leading up to the 1994 Daytona 500, and then tested by Jim Smith around Daytona International Speedway. The truck proved to be very popular among fans, and NASCAR arranged a meeting on April 11, 1994 that would ultimately lead to the founding of the "SuperTruck Series".</p>

                    <h4>Craftsman to Camping World</h4>
                    <p>Before the series could kick into high gear, 4 demonstration races were held during late 1994 and early 1995. There's no solid reason why, but it was probably because everything wanted to be checked to NASCAR's standards before more trucks can be built. Eventually, the inaugural race, the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, was held on February 5, 1995 at Phoenix International Raceway in Arizona. This race was won by Mike Skinner, who would go on to become series champion. Sears, Roebuck, & Co., through their Craftsman brand, served as the sponsor, and the series was renamed to the Craftsman Truck Series in 1996. At the end of the 2008 season, Craftsman ended its sponsorship of the series. Subsequently, Camping World signed a seven-year contract with NASCAR, rebranding the series as the Camping World Truck Series. However, the next year in 2009, the series began to lose money and costs of equipment started rising. This led to many teams shutting down truck operations for good. To cut costs, NASCAR started requiring teams to use sealed engines, with teams not being allowed to run at most 3 races with a previously-used engine. They would additionally reduce the maximum number of pit crew members allowed over the wall for a pit stop from seven to five, and required teams to only take either fuel or tires on a single pit stop that year. This was abandoned in the 2010 seaon.</p>

                    <h4>Gander RV & Outdoors, Back to Camping World, and the Return of Craftsman</h4>
                    <p>The sponsership with Camping World would last until for a long time. That is until May 8, 2018, when NASCAR and Camping World announced the Truck Series' title sponsorship would be switched to its subsidiary Gander Outdoors starting in 2019, renaming it the Gander Outdoors Truck Series. The series was slightly renamed to the Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series in 2020, but returned to the Camping World Truck Series branding for 2021 and 2022. On August 26, 2022, NASCAR announced a multi-year sponsorship deal with Stanley Black & Decker, which had acquired the Craftsman brand from Sears in 2017. Under which the series would return to being known as the Craftsman Truck Series beginning in 2023. As part of the deal, Stanley Black & Decker also became the official tool brand of NASCAR.</p>

                    <h4>Playoffs</h4>
                    <p>The Truck Series Championship was also determined by the overall points a driver has accumulated as well. And they wouldn't adopt the Cup Series' playoff format until 2016; the same time as the Xfinity Series. The Truck Series also uses a 3 round format like the Xfinity Series, but the eligibility for the Truck Series was even smaller; there were only 8 drivers that compete, and 2 drivers would be eliminated at the elimination rounds. However, in 2020, this would change. NASCAR expanded the number of playoff drivers that are eligible for the title from 8 to 10. This means that 2 drivers are eliminated in the first elimination round, and 4 would be eliminated the second.</p>
