                    <p>The second level of competition in NASCAR is the Xfinity Series. It's races are usually held as "support races" one day before the Cup Series race is held. As such, the Xfinity Series serves as a "stepping stone" for drivers who are looking to move up into the cup series. And many drivers spent some time in the Xfinity Series would go on to make their names in the Cup Series. Examples include many Cup champions such as Chase Elliot, Kevin Harvick, and Martin Truex Jr. Others include memorable names, like Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kyle Larson, Clint Bowyer, and Carl Edwards.</p>

                    <h3>Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>The series originated from NASCASR's Sportsman division, which was formed in the 1950s as a short-track division for the sport. This was the 4th series after the Modified and Roadster series in 1948 and the Strictly Stock series in 1949. These cars weren't model cars and could be modified, but not as much as car were in the Modified series. In 1968, it became the Late Model Sportsman Series and would hold races on large tracks like Daytona International Speedway. Obsolete Grand National cars were used on the larger tracks, but usually, the series used older compact cars. Other cars that were used include short track cars with small 300 cubic inch V-8 motors and smaller models during the current year that had V-6 motors.</p>

                    <h4>Modern Inception</h4>
                    <p>In 1982, the modern-day Xfinity Series was formed when Anheuser-Busch sponsered a newly reformed late-model sportsman series with the Budwiser brand. 2 years later, the sponser was switched with the Busch Beer brand and the series was renamed the "Busch Grand National Series". The "Grand National" name was eventually dropped in 2003, in keeping with NASCAR's brand identity. Anheuser-Busch dropped its sponsership of the seriesafter the 2007 season, and Nationwide Insurance took over for the 2008 season. The series was then renamed the "Nationwide Series". This would last for 7 years, and Comcast would become the new series sponser via its Xfinity brand. Thus, the Xfinity Series would reach full circle to its current inception.</p>

                    <h4>Outside the U.S.</h4>
                    <p>On March 6, 2005, the Xfinity Series held a race outside of the United States for the first time. The Telcel-Motorola 200 was held in Mexico City, Mexico at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. This was a road course track that hosted Formula One and Champ Car races in the past. This race was eventually won by Martin Truex Jr. 2 years later, on August 4, 2007, the second Xfinity race held outside the U.S. occured at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This track was also a road course, and the race was won by Kevin Harvick. The series' tenure in Mexico was short as after 3 years, it was announced the series wouldn't return. They would visit Montreal for 5 years, but same as Mexico, it was announced they wouldn't return.</p>

                    <h4>Playoffs</h4>
                    <p>For many years, the Xfinity Series championship was only determined by the highest number of points a driver has accumulated over the course of the season. Well, it wouldn't be until 2016 when the Xfinity Series would adopt a playoff format similar to the Cup Series. The only difference here is that the Xfinity Series uses a 3 round format, and the number of spots available for the playoffs are lowered from 16 to 12. Other than that, the rules of the playoffs are similar to that of the Cup Series.</p>
