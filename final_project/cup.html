                    <p>The NASCAR Cup Series is the highest level of competition in the sport. As such, it's also the most profitable and most popular. The first ever race was held at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1949, and was won by Jim Roper. By the end of that season, Red Byron would be crown the first ever series champion. This was held in what was known as the "Strictly Stock" division, after the sanctioning of Roadster and Modified races in 1948. As the 1950s arrived, the division was named the "Grand National Series" to sound more professional and prestigious. Back then, the races were held on dirt tracks, and it wasn't until Darlington Raceway was built in 1950 when paved tracks were being used. By the time Daytona International Speedway and other superspeedways were built, the dirt tracks were becoming obsolete.</p>

                    <h3>The 1970s</h3>
                    <p>When the 1970s arrived, the Cup Series gained its first series sponser: the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company brand "Winston". In 1971, tobacco companies were recently just banned from advertising their products on TV. So, they began to sponser sports events to work their way around the ban. With this, the series was renamed to the "NASCAR Winston Cup Series". And those changes due to RJR resulted in a shortening of the series schedule to 31 races per year. This would cement 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's "modern era". During this era, ABC aired partial and/or full telecasts of races from Talladega, North Wilksboro, Darlington, Charlotte, and Nashville. However, they were perceived as less exciting than other races, so ABC abandoned live coverage. It wasn't until 1979 when that year's Daytona 500 became the first stock car race to be broadcasted live from flag to flag on CBS. On the final lap, drivers Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison wrecked on the backstretch while fighting for the lead, allowing Richard Petty to win the race. Almost immediately, Yarborough, Allison, and Allison's brother Bobby engaged in a fight, which again, was broadcasted on national TV. This in turn underlined the drama and emotions of the sport and increased the broadcasting marketability.</p>

                    <h4>1990s and 2000s</h4>
                    <p>NASCAR's popularity went through a huge boom in the 1990s. In 1994, NASCAR held the first ever Brickyard 400 at the famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which was won by Jeff Gordon. Also, it saw the largest crowd to date to see a NASCAR race, and it was a sold-out crowd. Once the 2000s hit, R.J. Reynolds prematurely ended their sponser contract with NASCAR. Luckily, they negotiated a contract with a telecommunication company called Nextel, and the series was renamed the Nextel Cup Series. This would last 4 years before it was renamed again to the Sprint Cup Series in 2008, due to the merge between Sprint and Nextel. By 2009, the popularity boom of the 90s was over, and the TV ratings became less stagnant. Many long-time fans have criticized the series for losing its traditional appeal because it was abandoning venues in the sourthern part of the States in favor of newer markets.</p>

                    <h4>2010s and 2020s</h4>
                    <p>The Sprint sponsership lasted until 2016, and a new sponser was announced in December of that year: Monster Energy. With this new sponser, the NASCAR logo was given a simpler look, and the series was once again renamed, this time to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. In 2017, stage racing was first introduced. After completion of the stage, shown by the green-white checkered flag, the caution flag will come out. This allows everyone to gather themselves in preparation for the next stage during pit stops. Also,a regualar season championship is awarded to the driver who accumulated the most points throughout the regular season, which is 26 races. This doesn't award any bonus points to the winner of this, however. With the arrival of the 2020s, the series was renamed again. This time, it's simply the "NASCAR Cup Series". And as part of a tiered sponsership model, the series has 4 premier partners: Coca-Cola, GEICO, Busch Beer, and Xfinity. This has been the model of the series as of the present. Also, when the pandemic hit, and everything had to shut down, including sports events, NASCAR was the first sport to bring back competition, and they handled everything to near perfection. They started out with no fans at the tracks, but slowly began to allow fans to come out to the tracks, and just in time for the Championship Race, too.</p>

                    <h4>Playoffs</h4>
                    <p>After the regular season concludes, everything shifts as 16 drivers are thrown into the Playoffs. Today, the Playoffs are broken up into 4 rounds, 3 of which contain 3 races. The points are reset and any playoff points the driver earned will be carried over rounds. If a playoff driver wins a race, they guarantee themselves a spot in the next round. The 3 race in the round is the elimination race. After the end of this race, the drivers with the higher number of points above the cut-line move on, while those who don't are eliminated. For the Cup Series, after every round, 4 drivers are eliminated, and the group will grow shorter until there are only 4 drivers left. Those 4 go on to compete in the Championship race, and whoever finishes the best will be crowned series champion. In the Cup Series, there are only 3 drivers who have won 7 championships total, which has never been beaten. These drivers are Richard "The King" Petty, Dale Earnhardt, and Jimmie Johnson.</p>
