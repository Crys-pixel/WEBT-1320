                    <p>Among sporting events in the United States, none are more popular than NASCAR races. "NASCAR" stands for the National Association for Stock Car Racing, which every year, would host over 1,500 races across over 100 venues in 48 of 50 of the States. NASCAR's roots, as well as stock racing overall, goes all the way back to moonshine bootleggers during the Prohibition era. They would race against one another in shows of pride. At the same time, Daytona Beach, Florida had taken over as the preferred location to hold world land speed records. In 1935, a man named Bill France Sr. established a few races in Daytona in hopes that people would come to watch them, and that some racers would race for him. Different organizers tended to fleece winners of their cash payouts. This would prove to be a success, and after several meetings in Daytona, NASCAR was founded on February 21, 1948.</p>

                    <h3>The Rules</h3>
                    <h4>Practice and Qualifying</h4>
                    <p>Before each race, everyone would practice driving their car around the track for 1 or 2 laps, depending on the track they're visiting. There is nothing at stake, it just serves to see how the development of the car came along. Afterwards, everyone then goes through qualifying to determine their starting place in the race. The driver with the fastest time around the track after 1 or 2 laps, will be on the pole for the main race.</p>

                  <div class="col">
                    <h4>The Race</h4>
                    <p>Each race has a total number of laps to run which varies from race to race. Whoever stays in first place by the final lap will win, guarantee themselves a place in the playoffs, and gain points that will benefit the driver. Today, the races are broken up into 3 stages(4 in the cast of the longest race, the Coca-Cola 600). Similar to winning the race, whoever wins the stage will earn points that will help them get into the playoffs. These points, however, will only be given to the drivers in the top 10 positions. First will get 10, second gets 9, and will keep going down the line until it reaches the 10th position, who earns only one point.</p>

                    <h4 class="tstyle">Flags</h4>
                    <p>The flags are what control the race, and they are always displayed by a flagman perched on the flagstand that overlooks the start/finish line.</p>

                          <tr>
                          <td>Green - The race has started or restarted.</td>

                            <td>Blue - Used on road course tracks to signal slow or stopped cars to other drivers.</td>

                    <h4>Pit Stops</h4>
                    <p>Every once in a while the drivers will have to come down pit road to refuel and put on new tires. These pitstops would happen either during a green flag run, after the stage is complete, or when the race is under caution. Five pit crew members are permitted to go over the wall and service the car. This includes 2 tire changers, the tire carrier, the jackman, and the gas man. Aside from those, when the body of the car is damaged, they come out with tape to fix it. However, if a car is too heavily damaged and the crew can't repair it within 6 minutes, the driver is taken out of the race.</p>

                    <h4>Overtime</h4>
                    <p>In the event the caution flag comes out during the final laps of the race, the race will go into Overtime. In order to finish the race, two more laps will be run on the track. Once the leader takes the white flag, which means one lap to go, the next flag that comes out, whether it be the caution or the checkered flag, will mark the end of the race. However, if the caution comes out before the white flag is displayed, the field would be reset and another attempt will be made.</p>
